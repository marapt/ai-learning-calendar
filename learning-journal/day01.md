# Day 1 – Python & Terminal Basics

Today I learned how to:

- Open the terminal and navigate to my project folder.
- Start the Python interpreter using `python3`.
- Understand the difference between:
  - **Shell commands** (e.g. `python3`, `ls`, `cd`)
  - **Python code** (e.g. `x = 1`, `print(x)`)

## Code I practiced

```python
x = 1
print(x)      # Output: 1

x = x + 1
print(x)      # Output: 2
# Day 1 – Python & Terminal Foundations

Today I learned the foundation of using Python through the terminal, including how to start the Python interpreter, understand the REPL environment, and run simple code line by line. This helped me understand how Python evaluates expressions and how variables store and update values.

## 🔧 What I Practiced Today

### ✔ Started the Python interpreter  
By typing `python3` in the terminal, I entered the Python REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop), which shows the `>>>` prompt.

### ✔ Understood the difference between:
- **Shell commands** (e.g., `python3`, `ls`, `cd`)
- **Python code** (e.g., `x = 1`, `print(x)`)

### ✔ Ran Python code interactively  
I tested small pieces of code directly in the interpreter and observed how each line executed immediately.

## 🧪 Code I Practiced

```python
x = 1
print(x)      # Output: 1

x = x + 1
print(x)      # Output: 2
